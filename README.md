TS3-Autochannel
===============

This little PHP script automatically creates Channels if all others are occupied and also deletes them after they aren't needed any more.

There are some requirements to the channel structure:

1. A root channel
2. sub channels (genres, games, modes...)
3. group channels <- these are for users

The root channels can be nested of course and you can set exceptional channels which are ignored during the excecution.

You can have a look at it live on the TS3 server gamemodeon.de
